Method 1
- compile Build.ahk and Update.ahk as executables and add them to path
- run them in code file directories

Method 2
- run Scheduler.ahk with instructions
- boxname, launchrule will find the box, set its launch rule and run it
- boxname, v0.0 will build a new box from the directory of the boxname
- boxname, vX.X will update an existing box in the directory of the boxname with git checkout and pull of branch vX.X

Method 2's build
- git clone the new box (what if it exists?)
- build a new box with reference to that directory

Method 2's update
- navigate to the existing box directory
- do a git pull
- do a git checkout of the branch to be tested
